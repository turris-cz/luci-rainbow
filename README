This repository has one hack. I need to keep two different versions together -
HW specific content. We don't want to have 2 packages and Lua doesn't know any
compile time ifdef's'.

I will use ifdef in package definition to copy relevant files. In package, there
isn't any "build", it just makes copy.

Symbolic link to some set of source files is for development purposes only.
